The cmdlet is used to add members, owners, or subscribers to a Microsoft 365 Group. This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service. To modify a Microsoft 365 Group, you can also use the Set-UnifiedGroup cmdlet.

Before you run this command, you need to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. You can do this by using the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet.
